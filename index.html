    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 tablespoons of salted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 & 1/2 cups all purpose flour (6.75 ounces)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt <i>(but I always add a little extra)</i></li>

    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds to just barely melt it.</li>
        <li>Using a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the butter with the sugars until creamy. Add the vanilla and the egg; beat on low speed until just incorporated – 10-15 seconds</li>
        <li>Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until crumbles form. Use your hands to press the crumbles together into a dough. Add the chocolate chips and incorporate with your hands.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough into 12 large balls and place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes until the cookies look puffy and dry and just barely golden.</li>
        <li>Let them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr/>
    <p>And there you have it- dense, buttery and soft chocolate chip cookies! Enjoy!</p>
